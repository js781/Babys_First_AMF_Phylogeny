Project Title: What would it look like visualizing and comparing Klamath Falls, Oregon's Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Fungi (AMF) organisms with Indonesia's AMF?

Body: California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt; BIOL 580 (43469)

Heading: Research Vision, Milestones to Reach, and Expected Outcomes and Impacts.
Body: Js781 wishes to taxonomically understand the relationship between Banyuasin and Klamath Falls (KF) sites' AMF composition. Banyuasin (B) is a coastal
region in South Sumatra, Indonesia. The area has tidally influenced marsh villages that see anthropological activity. Due to salt and flooding proximity,
B's AMF taxon data can provide a contrast to KF sites. While salt gradient and zonation with tidal influence may affect niche partitioning, they may be
key observations to contrast with KF's annual flooding and salt flat proximities. 

Body: We must reach several milestones before completely presenting a conclusion to others. We must access the taxonomic identifications of all 
experimental 18S DNA from the KF sites. This will be compared to identifications of established data from B sites. The taxa of both sites must be attached
together after creating distinct and seperate phylogenetic trees. This will provide ease of access for future data manipulation. Inferences can be made
after: 1. extraneous background research 2. compilied phylogeny tree. 

Body: We expect accessible AMF phylogenetic data for benevolent and interested parties. The KF sites hold critically endangered legumes named Astragalus
applegatei, to whom share an obligate symbiosis. We wish to expand known knowledge about these legume by understanding their symbionts in context. If this
research provides more insight into species interactions, then people may better understand how to specifically expand applegatei's population count. I
opt to this in case others wish for its extant persistence.
